## Description

Using the [vba_excel_export_code](https://github.com/cavo789/vba_excel_export_code) script, it's possible to export all codes from an Excel workbooks to files so it becomes easy to store code in versioning system like github.

This script will do the opposite: load external files to an Excel workbook. You can manipulate your codebase outside Excel (outside the old VBE editor), apply tools like prettiers, ... and import files back in Excel, for instance.

## Install

Just get a copy of the `.vbs` script, perhaps the `.cmd` too (for your easiness) and save them in the same folder of your Excel application (containing the code you want to export).

## Usage

Just edit the `.cmd` file and you'll see how it works: you just need to run the `.vbs` with one parameter, the name of the folder where your codebase is saved. Or, with a second parameter, the name of the file where code has to be imported.

## How to use

This script will ask up to two parameters:

1. The folder where your codebase is saved
2. An optional existing workbook filename where code will be imported.

Imagine you've your codebase saved in the `c:\repository\my_application\src`. There, you've `.bas`, `.cls` and/or `.frm` files that were generated by the [vba_excel_export_code](https://github.com/cavo789/vba_excel_export_code)  script.

To import them in a new Excel workbook just run this script like this:

```bash
cscript run.vbs c:\repository\my_application\src
```

By giving only one parameter, the source folder, a new, empty, Excel workbook will be created and files from `c:\repository\my_application\src` will be imported one by one.

You can specify a filename as a second parameter like below:

```bash
cscript run.vbs c:\repository\my_application\src app.xlsm
```

Here, the script will open the `app.xlsm` workbook (need to exists on disk) and import codebase it that file.
